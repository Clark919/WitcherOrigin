The probability is between 1%-5%, depending on the rarity of encountering the mob (higher rarity = higher drop chance)."

While holding a contract for a mob, you are eligible to harvest their trophy with a 100% chance. The criteria are:$(li2)$(l:contracts/enemy_types)You must be wielding the correct blade type for the monster you are hunting in your mainhand.$()$(li2)You must deal the final blow yourself, without using projectiles. This means you cannot land a killing blow with an offhand crossbow to harvest a trophy."
