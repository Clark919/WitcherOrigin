Additionally, you do not wear helmets to increase your visibility and allow for easy potion consumption (Limited to Leather, Chain, Witcher Armours)."

Become Nauseated and Weakened when touching a Nether Portal.$(li)$(l)Magic Vulnerability$() - Though a skilled fighter, you can still be bested by magic, causing you to take more damage from magic sources."
